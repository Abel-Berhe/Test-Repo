# INFT3000 Capstone Project
# Weather Wardrobe

The Website 'Weather Wardrobe' utilizes a weather API to gather current weather information and images of clothing items to suggest the general outfit based on the current weather conditions. The website allows users to input their location, then the app then uses the current temperature, precipitation, and other weather data to suggest an appropriate outfit. With its user-friendly interface and accurate weather-based suggestions, Weather Wardrobe makes getting dressed in the morning a breeze.

# Goals
Weather Integration -	a customizable weather App is a useful tool  ✔️ <br>
Outfit Suggestion	- A customizable outfit suggestion software is a very valuable asset to the right person  ✔️ <br>
Clothing database -	A clothing tracking system is a useful tool ❌ <br>
Adding to a clothing database -	In addition to a clothing database the ability to add to it to track your clothes will be very useful ❌ <br>

# Scope 
WPF application ❌<br><br>
We decided to pivot to a website using JavaScript instead of a WPF application as we were having issues making progress with the WPF application.
