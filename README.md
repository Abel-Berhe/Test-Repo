# Weather Wardrobe

The Website 'Weather Wardrobe' utilizes a weather API to gather current weather information and images of clothing items to suggest the general outfit based on the current weather conditions. The website allows users to input their location, then the app then uses the current temperature, precipitation, and other weather data to suggest an appropriate outfit. With its user-friendly interface and accurate weather-based suggestions, Weather Wardrobe makes getting dressed in the morning a breeze.
